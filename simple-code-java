### Java tips, tricks and sample code ###

In this part of the sample Java code article, we will introduce some important tips and tricks that you should follow in the initial stages of learning this language.


-Return an empty collection instead of {Null}

#If a program returns a collection that has no values, you must ensure that an empty collection is returned, not {Null}.
This way you don't have to run a lot of {ifâ€¦else} code on {Null} elements.

*Example:

public class getLocationName {
    return (null==cityName ? "": cityName);
}


-Use strings carefully

#If two strings are concatenated using the (+) operator in a {for} loop, a new String Object is created each time.
This will waste memory and reduce time performance. 
Also, when instantiating the string object, you should not use constructors and this instantiation should be done directly.

*Consider the following example:

  //Slower Instantiation
  String bad = new String("Yet another string object");
      
  //Faster Instantiation
  String good = "Yet another string object"


-Avoid creating unnecessary objects

#One of the most expensive types of operations in terms of memory consumption in Java is the object creation operation. 
Therefore, it is recommended that objects be built or instantiated only when necessary.

*You can see an example of this in the code below:

  import java.util.ArrayList;
  import java.util.List;
 
  public class Employees {
 
      private List Employees;
 
      public List getEmployees() {
 
          //initialize only when required
          if(null == Employees) {
              Employees = new ArrayList();
          }
          return Employees;
      }
  }


-The difficult problem of choosing "Array" or "ArrayList"

#Often, developers are confused about choosing between "Array" and "ArrayList" data structures. 
Both of these cases have their own strengths and weaknesses. 
Choosing one of these two in practice depends on your requirements.

*Look at this exaple:

  import java.util.ArrayList;
 
  public class arrayVsArrayList {
 
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          int[] myArray = new int[6];
          myArray[7]= 10; // ArraysOutOfBoundException
 
          //Declaration of ArrayList. Add and Remove of elements is easy.
          ArrayList<Integer> myArrayList = new ArrayList<>();
          myArrayList.add(1);
          myArrayList.add(2);
          myArrayList.add(3);
          myArrayList.add(4);
          myArrayList.add(5);
          myArrayList.remove(0);
         
          for(int i = 0; i < myArrayList.size(); i++) {
          System.out.println("Element: " + myArrayList.get(i));
          }
         
          //Multi-dimensional Array 
          int[][][] multiArray = new int [3][3][3]; 
      }
  }


Arrays are of fixed size, but list arrays are of variable size. 
Since the size of the array is fixed, its memory is allocated at the time of declaring the variable of "array" type. 
Hence, arrays perform very fast. 
On the other hand, if we don't know the size of the data in advance, 
in this case, inserting more data than the capacity of the array will cause an "ArrayOutOfBoundException" exception, and inserting less items will also waste memory.

#Two points:
*It is easier to add and remove elements to an ArrayList than to an Array.
*An array can be multidimensional, but an ArrayList can only have one dimension.


-Sometimes Finally doesn't execute after Try

Consider the following code snippet:

  public class shutDownHooksDemo {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
          {
              try {
                  if(i==4) {
                      System.out.println("Inside Try Block.Exiting without executing Finally block.");
                      System.exit(0);
                  }
              }
              finally {
                  System.out.println("Inside Finally Block.");
              }
          }
      }
  }

By looking at this piece of code, you might think that the "println" inside the "finally" block is executed 5 times, but if you run the program, you will notice that the "finally" block is executed only four times. 
In the fifth execution, the "exit" function is called, and as a result, "finally" will never be called for the fifth time. 
This is because "System.exit" stops all running threads, including the current one. Even the "finally" block after "try" will not be executed if "exit" is executed.

When "System.exit" is called, the "JVM" performs pre-shutdown cleanup tasks.
Thus, it first executes all "shutdown" hooks registered using the "Runtime.addShutdownHook" hook.
This mode is useful because it frees up resources external to the "JVM".

Another reason for this is related to "Finalizers", which are either "System.runFinalizersOnExit" or "Runtime.runFinalizersOnExit". 
"Finalizers" have long been deprecated. "Finalizers" can only be executed on live objects while they are being manipulated by other threads. 
In this way, unpredictable results or even deadlocks occur.

#Example:

public class shutDownHooksDemo {
 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
            for(int i=0;i<5;i++)
            {
                    final int final_i = i;
                    try {
                            Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(
                                            new Thread() {
                                            public void run() {
                                            if(final_i==4) {
                                            System.out.println("Inside Try Block.Exiting without executing Finally block.");
                                            System.exit(0);
                                            }
                                            }
                                            });
                    }
                    finally {
                            System.out.println("Inside Finally Block.");
                    }
 
            }
    }
}
